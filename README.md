</div>

## Project Description

This project is a collaborative effort aimed at enhancing the user interface (UI) of a pre-existing repository[repository](https://github.com/iamuzi/WorkoutApp) . Leveraging the existing codebase, Have worked diligently to address UI-related issues, fix bugs, and introduce new screens to elevate the overall user experience and also add State management With Bloc.

### Key Contributions:

- **UI Enhancements:**focused on refining the visual aesthetics, ensuring a cleaner and more user-friendly interface. This involved revamping existing components and introducing design elements for a polished appearance.

- **Bug Fixes:** Dedicated efforts to identify and rectify bugs present in the original codebase. This includes addressing issues related to functionality, responsiveness, and overall system stability.

- **New Screens:** Building upon the foundation laid by the original repository,  introduced new screens to expand the app's functionality. These screens are thoughtfully designed to seamlessly integrate with the existing structure.

- **Bloc State Management**: Introduced Bloc state management to streamline application state and improve code organization.

- **Collaboration with Existing Codebase**: Demonstrated proficiency in working with an existing codebase, showcasing the ability to seamlessly integrate new features and improvements.

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The project is structured using Clean Architecture principles, which divide the codebase into several layers:</p>
<p>The project is structured using Clean Architecture principles, which divide the codebase into several layers:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Presentation Layer:</strong> This layer contains UI components, including screens, widgets, and Flutter-specific code.</li>
  <li><strong>Domain Layer:</strong> Here, we define the business logic and use cases of the application. It includes the core business rules and entities.</li>
  <li><strong>Data Layer:</strong> This layer manages data sources, repositories, and data models. It handles data retrieval and storage.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Clean Separation of Concerns:</strong> Clear separation between layers for better maintainability and testability.</li>
  <li><strong>Sample Use Cases:</strong> Includes sample interactions and use cases.</li>
  <li><strong>Organized Project Structure:</strong> A well-organized structure for easy navigation and development.</li>
</ul>



<p>Used several packages to facilitate Clean Architecture and improve developer productivity, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>get_it</strong> for dependency injection.</li>
  <li><strong>dio</strong> for making network requests.</li>
  <li><strong>equatable</strong> for value equality.</li>
  <li><strong>bloc</strong> for state management.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the complete list of dependencies, refer to the pubspec.yaml file.</p>
